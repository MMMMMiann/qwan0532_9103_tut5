#### This webpage is an online exhibition introduction homepage. Viewed from a plane, this is a figure composed of multiple circles of different sizes. Viewed as a three-dimensional pattern, irregular circles become cylinders, which are cut into unique shapes. And in both modes, the graphics are constantly rotating around the center. I think this is an interesting design example of converting flat graphics into three-dimensional patterns. Because the artworks provided in the assignment are all flat, how to display these artworks in more dimensions is a direction that can be considered.

**Coding Technique**

#### This is a piece of code that can generate various 3D graphics, and these 3D graphics rotate continuously around the center. The graphics in part1 can be realized by superimposing multiple cylinders. Filling these cylinders with the gradient color and adding the stroke color can roughly restore the coding of the graphics far away from the center in the part1 screenshot.
