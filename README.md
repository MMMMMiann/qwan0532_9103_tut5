#### This webpage is an online exhibition introduction homepage. Viewed from a plane, this is a figure composed of multiple circles of different sizes. Viewed as a three-dimensional pattern, irregular circles become cylinders, which are cut into unique shapes. And in both modes, the graphics are constantly rotating around the center. I think this is an interesting design example of converting flat graphics into three-dimensional patterns. Because the artworks provided in the assignment are all flat, how to display these artworks in more dimensions is a direction that can be considered.
